# Todo — pare

The unscheduled backlog: everything known to be worth doing that nobody has committed to a date.
Items enter here from anywhere (a review comment, an out-of-scope note, a bug found in passing)
and leave by being promoted into `status/next.md` or dropped with a reason.

Keep it honest rather than tidy. A backlog that only contains things someone intends to do is a
wish list; the value is in recording the ones nobody has got to yet.

## Now-ish

Small, clear, and could be picked up without a design decision.

- (nothing yet)

## Later

Real, but needs a decision, a dependency, or more information first. Say which.

- Lexer leniency vs TypeScript (M4): no validation of escapes inside strings, templates and
  regex (TS1125, TS1198, TS1199), numeric separator placement (TS6188, TS6189), leading-zero
  decimals in strict code (TS1489), binary/octal digit ranges (TS1177, TS1178). Tokenization is
  unaffected; a browser rejects such input. Decide whether `Strip` should reject them. Run the
  corpus test with `PARE_CORPUS_VERBOSE=1` to list them (`MISSED` lines).
- Unicode tables: identifier classes come from .NET's `CharUnicodeInfo`, whose Unicode version
  may differ from TypeScript's and browsers'. Only matters for exotic identifiers.

## Dropped

Not doing, with the reason. Kept so the same idea does not get re-raised every quarter.
